# DC-Motor-Control
This project focuses on controlling the speed of a separately excited DC motor using a 4-quadrant (4Q) reversible chopper based on IGBTs (Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistors). The goal is to simulate and implement a reliable speed control system for industrial applications that demand high-performance motor drives.
